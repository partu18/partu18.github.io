# Introduction

Hi there!

I'm Partu a passionate about information security, currently working as Security Researcher at Onapsis.
I'm also fan of CTF's, specially when challenges about crypto and reversing are present.

I wanted to share in some way the little things I do in my spare time, such as tools, CTF write ups, researches, etc.
Hope you enjoy it!
